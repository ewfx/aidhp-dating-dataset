Subject: Unlock Exciting Rewards Tailored Just for You!

Dear [Customer's Name],

I hope this email finds you well and thriving in your role as a Marketing Manager! With your passion for digital marketing, social media, and travel, I’m excited to introduce two credit card options that align perfectly with your lifestyle and spending habits.

**Primary Recommendation: Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card**
With your frequent dining out and travel, the Autograph Card is an ideal match. You’ll earn **3X points** on restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, and streaming services, which means your everyday expenses can work harder for you. Plus, enjoy a **$300 cash rewards bonus** after spending just **$3,000 in the first 3 months**. Imagine all the experiences you can enjoy with those points!

**Secondary Recommendation: Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card**
If you prefer a straightforward rewards approach, the Active Cash Card offers **unlimited 2% cash rewards** on all purchases—a great way to maximize your earnings on everything you buy. With a **$200 cash rewards bonus** after a mere **$1,000 in the first 3 months**, it’s a fantastic option. Additionally, you’ll have the peace of mind of **cell phone protection** up to $600, perfect for a professional on the go.

Both cards are designed to complement your busy lifestyle while rewarding your savvy spending. I encourage you to review these options and see which one aligns best with your financial goals.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance in applying. Your next adventure awaits!

Warm regards,
